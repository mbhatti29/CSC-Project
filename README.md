# CSC 599.70 Introduction To Data Science - Final Project

## Overview

Climate change has certainly become one of humanity's greatest threats.  It is defined as the change in global or regional patterns in climate.  Advancements in technology have allowed scientists to collect various types of data regarding our changing planet, which has led to many significant discoveries.

The primary theories we looked into and the objectives we aimed to achieve by analyzing a few selected datasets relate to the effects of global and regional increases in temperature, and its progression due to greenhouse gas emissions.  More specifically:
* Linear and non-linear regressional analysis on average global and regional temperatures
* The geographical correlation to increasing temperatures
* Prediction of increasing carbon dioxide atmospheric concentration
* Impact of fossil fuel combustion, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases
